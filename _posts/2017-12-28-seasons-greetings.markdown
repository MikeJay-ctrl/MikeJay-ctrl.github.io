Happy New Year everybody!

I had a bit of time over Christmas and decided to get started with an NLP project that's been in my head for some time.

One of the reasons I hadn't started is because there is no dataset that I could find that contains Song Lyrics, Genre, Artist Name and Year of release in one set. It was also important to me that the Lyrics came only came from 'popular' songs. Therefore the lyrics included in this dataset are from the top 100 albums from the 70's 80's 90's and 00's.

In addition to that I've added an extra helping of Hip-Hop albums into the Mix because it was very underrepresented before the late 90's.

The Dataset is provided in a .csv format and also an sqlite3.db file.

Both have been zipped and are available from the link on this page.
